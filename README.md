# Hospitalization Prediction for Elderly Population

The Mexican Health and Aging Survey (MHAS) is a rich dataset that provides a unique opportunity to predict hospitalization events for adults over the age of 50. Hospitalizations can be a significant burden for the elderly, their families, and the healthcare system, and predicting the likelihood of hospitalization events can help in the early detection and prevention of adverse health outcomes.

This project aims to predict the likelihood of hospitalization events for Mexican adults over the age of 50 using data from the MHAS survey. The survey provides information on various demographic, health, and lifestyle-related factors, including age, gender, marital status, education level, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, chronic conditions, physical limitations, and mental health status.

The MHAS Dataset is public and free of charge for use but you will have to register on their website to get full access. You can see all the available data in the following [link](https://www.mhasweb.org/DataProducts/Home.aspx).
